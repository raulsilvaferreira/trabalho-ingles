        <h2>Solitude</h2>
        <p>Being alone sometimes can be a great experience for self development, solitude is the situation which someone prefers being alone than with people. Great thinkers once said that we can not see much things, except if we are just by ourselves.</p>
        <p>Nevertheless, solitude isn't about avoiding people, is just about being with your self just for a moment, can be minutes, hours, days, months even years.</p>

        <h2>Loneliness</h2>
        <p>Being alone alone can be horrible as can be good (the good part is when the solitude comes in), the fact that you don't have someone in the most needed moments can hurt.</p>
        <p>Unfortunately, the pandemic showed this in the hard way, the number of depressed people around the world increased much faster that anyone could imagine at that time, at that time, the world realized that we need each other.</p>
        <p>In happy, sad, healthy and sick moments, the only thing that matters is our family, friends, anyway, we need PEOPLE. If you see someone in a bad moment, go and help, probably you're going to be a angel for this person.</p>
        <p>The message I'm trying to pass on is: Do something that you wished someone have done for you.</p>
